# Placing an Order for another Company

### Requirements
You must be Authorized to create an Order on behalf of the intended Company. Your Runbuggy support contact
 can work with you to establish this authorization.

## Step 1: Retrieve the Authorized Company 
You'll need their ID to place the Order.

Options:
* [Retrieve a list](/docs/shipping/771dc5fc13fd4-retrieve-authorized-companies) of all Companies for whom you are Authorized.
* [Retrieve a specific Company](/docs/shipping/4db78a65f06fc-retrieve-authorized-companies-by-user) for whom you are Authorized by providing their username.

## Step 2: Create Order with other Payer
[Create Order](/docs/shipping/6fcc8c040ec03-create-an-order) using the authorized
 company as the payer.
